# Contributing to Awesome Free AI Resources

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

## How Can I Contribute?

### Adding a New Resource

1. **Ensure the resource is free** - It must have a meaningful free tier or be completely free
2. **Check it's not already listed** - Search the README first
3. **Verify the link works** - Test the URL before submitting

### Submitting Changes

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-new-resource
   ```
3. **Make your changes** to the README.md
4. **Commit** with a clear message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add [Resource Name] to [Category]"
   ```
5. **Push** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin add-new-resource
   ```
6. **Open a Pull Request**

## Guidelines

### Format for New Entries

**For tables:**
```markdown
| [Tool Name](https://url.com) | Brief description | Free tier info |
```

**For lists:**
```markdown
- [Resource Name](https://url.com) - Brief description
```

### Quality Standards

- ✅ Resource must be **actively maintained**
- ✅ Link must be **working** and point to official site
- ✅ Description must be **concise** (under 10 words preferred)
- ✅ Free tier must be **meaningful** (not just a 3-day trial)
- ✅ Add in **alphabetical order** within the category

### What NOT to Submit

- ❌ Paid-only resources
- ❌ Abandoned/unmaintained projects
- ❌ Duplicate entries
- ❌ Self-promotional content without disclosure
- ❌ Resources requiring payment after very short trials

## Suggesting New Categories

If you think a new category is needed:

1. Open an **Issue** first to discuss
2. Explain why the new category is needed
3. Provide at least 3-5 resources that would fit

## Reporting Issues

Found a broken link or outdated info?

1. Open an **Issue**
2. Include the resource name and what's wrong
3. Suggest a fix if possible

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Keep discussions on-topic
